Reactron is a product aimed at aiding in the development of React Apps. Reactron has been developed with the support of the open source community through OS Labs and as a result is available as an open source product.

Developing with React is all about understanding component relationships to each other, to state, and to props and this often leads to confusing and complex  tasks of tracing paths through the your app. In addition, React’s declarative approach to creating UI makes generating many complex components very easy but seeing those components render often has to wait until late in the development process and often relies on hard to achieve instances of state.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Reactron aims to solve this by providing a way to visualize and test your components before they are even a part of the page of your App and independent of the app's current state. Load your project into Reactron with the intuitive file system navigator, and see your project displayed onscreen. Reactron will then map the current fiber tree of your app and allow you to pick from any component you've uploaded, currently rendered or not, and interact with that component via its state, props, and built in functionality.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Reactron seeks to push test-driven development (TDD) to the front of the developer’s process.
